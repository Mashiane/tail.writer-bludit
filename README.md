tail.writer - The flavored Markup Editor for Bludit
===================================================
The **tail.writer** script is a neat, powerful, highly extend- and translatable Markup Editor,
written in Vanilla JavaScript. It currently supports the [GitHub Flavored] Markdown, BBCode and
Textile Markup languages.

**Note:** This repository contains the [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com) Plugin (and version) of the
[tail.writer](https://www.github.com/pytesNET/tail.writer) JavaScript package. So you can use this
editor outside of Bludit too!

### WYSIWYG vs. Markup
The tail.writer script is **not a WYSIWYG** (What you see is what you get) editor, it's a Markup
editor. The difference is the presentation of the written text: A WYSIWYG editor shows a bold text
directly as **bold text**, while a Markup editor shows only the Markup syntax: \*\*bold text\*\*.
(The shown syntax depends on the used Markup language, of course!)
